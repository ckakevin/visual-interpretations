    <h1>Pulling Our Weight</h1>
<p>
<div id="box">
  In time we might walk the straight line
  but with memories of a grapevine
  guitar, as we came close from afar
  forgot about the war.
  We barely touched,
  as if being watched
  and even in time
  we'll give in to crime
  we'll be on the line
  pulling our weight.
  Many miles from where I'm sleeping
  you share laughter in the evening
  as do I, in the great divine
  yours is mine.
  we'll find love
  the kind we're dreaming of
  and even in time
  we'll give in to crime
  we'll be on the line
  pulling our weight.
